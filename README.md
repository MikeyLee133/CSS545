HW#0-Getting Started
1. The plan is to create an IOS App
2. The intended framework/language is Swift for now
3. I think I might try and use React Native, so possibly making it cross-platform is a possibility
4. This is my first time trying to create a mobile app and after doing some research it seems that the combination of Swift and React native is very popular in mobile IOS development. Swift is Apple's modern programming language for the majority of their devices, while React Native allows cross-platform development. I am not completely sure if you can use both Swift and React Native together but will do more research once I have come up with a more solid idea. The reason I choose IOS is mainly because I use IOS devices mostly in my life.
